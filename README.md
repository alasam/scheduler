# Interview Scheduler

Our Interview Scheduler is a single page application made with React. The application allows users to book appointments with the interviewers provided, edit made appointments, and cancel/delete already booked appointments. Data is stored and retrieved using PostgreSQL, as well as tested using Jest, Storybook, and as well as Cypress.
